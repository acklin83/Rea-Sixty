# Rea-Sixty v0.9.1, "Fifteen Milliseconds of Fame"

**ORC now runs on Windows, and Rea-Sixty works with it there.**

## Install via ReaPack (recommended)

Under Extensions, ReaPack, Manage repositories, Import/export, Import repositories. Paste:

```
https://github.com/acklin83/reaper-scripts/raw/main/index.xml
```

Then Browse packages, `Rea-Sixty`, Install. Restart REAPER. Add the surface under Preferences, Control/OSC/Web, Add, Rea-Sixty.

First-run setup buttons live under Settings, About:

- **Windows:** "Install UF8/UC1/UF1 WinUSB driver" (UAC prompt)
- **Linux:** "Install Linux udev rule" (pkexec prompt)
- **macOS:** nothing extra

## What's new

- **ORC on Windows:** with ORC 1.6.1 or later installed, REAPER takes the UF1 and the UF8 over from ORC when it starts and hands them back when it quits, as on a Mac. *Take the UF1 over from ORC* under Settings, Connected devices, switches that off.
- **TotalMix on the surfaces under Windows:** with ORC installed, `SHIFT` + `MODE` offers RME on the UF1, and `SHIFT` + `LAYER 1` puts TotalMix on the left UF8.

## Known issues

- Two UF8s has not been run on two units yet. One UF8 works as before, with *Second UF8* off.
- MIDI CC layer: if Settings shows *Device busy* next to the layer's Input, switch the device off as an input in REAPER's MIDI preferences.
- Windows 11 with Smart App Control on refuses to load Rea-Sixty ("Bad Image", error 0xc0e90002): the extension is not code-signed. Turning Smart App Control off lets it load.
- On a track without the envelope yet, the first pot turn in Touch goes through REAPER's usual path, which creates the envelope, and the value returns once. From the second turn on, the pot writes its point.
- FX Cycle, Instance Cycle and Favourites cycling show their prev/current/next carousel on the UC1 only. On a UF1 the landed plug-in name appears, without the neighbours.
- OBS chapter marks need one of OBS's Hybrid recording formats; on anything else OBS refuses the request and the status line says so.

## Manual install

If ReaPack isn't an option:

- **macOS:** `rea-sixty-mac-v0.9.1.zip`, unzip the three `.dylib` files into `~/Library/Application Support/REAPER/UserPlugins/`.
- **Windows:** `rea-sixty-win-v0.9.1.zip`, unzip the three `.dll` files into `%APPDATA%\REAPER\UserPlugins\`. Run the WinUSB driver installer from Settings, About on first launch.
- **Linux:** `rea-sixty-linux-v0.9.1.tar.gz`, unpack **all three** files (`reaper_rea-sixty.so`, `libusb-1.0.so.0`, `libhidapi-hidraw.so.0`) into `~/.config/REAPER/UserPlugins/`, keeping them together. Apply the bundled `99-rea-sixty.rules` udev rule, or use the in-app button. No separate dependency install needed.

The **Stream Deck Companion** plugin (`com.reasixty.companion.streamDeckPlugin`) is attached to this release separately, it is not part of the ReaPack package.
